### Abstract 
 Precipitation prediction is a popular topic in the field of weather forecasting, as it
 provides many benefits for various occupations. For example, farmers can use rain
fall prediction to plan crop planting and irrigation, thus maximizing rainfall usage
 and improving yield and quality in agriculture. Additionally, precipitation predic
tion can aid in disaster prevention and reduction efforts by enabling authorities to
 take early action to reduce the harm of natural disasters such as floods and land
slides. Several commonly used methods for precipitation prediction exist, includ
ing the time series method, Bayesian method, and artificial neural network method.
 Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages that need to be im
proved upon. For instance, the time series method processes precipitation data in
dividually and does not incorporate other factors such as humidity or wind speed,
 potentially missing useful information. Additionally, this method is sensitive to data
 noise and outliers, requiring complex data preprocessing and filtering. On the other
 hand, the Bayesian method relies heavily on model assumptions and prior distri
bution choices, which can significantly impact predicted results. Furthermore, the
 predictive power of this method may be weak for cases with few data samples or
 insufficient prior knowledge. Lastly, the artificial neural network method requires a
 large number of parameters and lacks interpretability, making it challenging to ex
plain the reasoning behind the results. In this article, we introduce the functional
 neural network (FuncNN) as a potential solution to these problems. The FuncNN
 method is capable of handling multi-covariates, eliminating the need to find a suit
able prior distribution as with the Bayesian method. Furthermore, FuncNN requires
 fewer parameters than the artificial neural network method while also improving
 interpretability.
